CO2 increase results in a higher level of the greenhouse effect.,Assumed constant in this scenario.,Assumed constant in this scenario.,"Responds to tempurature, but it takes more time than 200 years.","Sea level responds to ocean temperature, volcanic activity, and ice level.  It won't change in the 100-200 year time scale.",Assumed constant in this scenario.,"As temperature increases, evaporation increases, leading to an increase in precipitation.  Increased precipitation increases the weathering rate.","Carbonate Deposition depends on the rate calcium release due to weathering (calcium and carbon are the raw materials that make up carbonates.  As weathering increases, so does the calcium release rate.  However, it takes about 100,000 years for the carbonate deposition rate to change. ","Sedimentation increases as weathering increases.  However, it will take time for increased sedimentation to bury more carbon. ","Increased atmospheric CO2 allows rainfall to dissolve more CO2 as it falls.  Higher dissolved CO2 attacks rocks and releases more Ca from them.  This provides more raw materials for carbonate production.  However, life has to respond to the increase of these materials, and that takes time (on the 100,000 year time scale).  Thus at this time scale, weather does not increase enough for its level to change.  ",

CO2 increase results in a higher level of the greenhouse effect.,Assumed constant in this scenario.,Assumed constant in this scenario.,"Higher temperatures, even in the 100-200 year time scale, melt ice.  In 200 years, this melting was not enough to impact the ice level.  However, by 100,000 years, warming temperatures have melted all the ice.  The planet has entered a hothouse state.","Sea level responds to ocean temperature, volcanic activity, and ice level.  Melting ice dumped large volumes of water into the oceans, causing sea level to rise.  Increased temperatures cause ocean temperatures to rise.  Warmer water expands, creating higher volume, also increasing sea level.  Since we assume volcanic activity remains constant in this scenario, it has no effect on sea level.
